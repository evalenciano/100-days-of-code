# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a new project to help out with a small task at church. My first goal is to create a command line tool that requests a bible reference and splits each verse, creating a new line paragraph per verse.

**Thoughts:** Since I'm on a new machine, I had to download brew and node -- it's nice starting fresh on a machine. I'm looking forward to playing around more with JavaScript since it's not my go-to language and would like to practice it more.
